## Welcome to Alter Earth's GitHub Page

What is Alter Earth?

An open platform for the general public, researchers, data publishers, content creators, makers and application developers, which enables easy sharing and collaboration of human behaviors that improve the overall health of Earth.

Some of the ways Alter Earth fosters common education and awareness is by tracking and providing:

* Earth's core environmental health metrics
* global community for sharing and collaboration with like-minded Earthlings

Why Alter Earth?  Today, many, if not most people are aware of the alarming state of Earth's climate change including, global warming, mass extinctions, arctic ice melt, rising sea levels, drought, greenhouse gasses and such. Often times, individuals may want to help, but wonder "how can I make a difference?" and "even though I take action on a daily basis, how do I know if my actions or the actions of a larger group collectively make any difference?".  Apathy may set in, or other things in life take priority.  With Alter Earth, we hope to answer these and other questions, and show that "yes, many people do care" and take action every day, not just on Earth Day or Earth Hour.  Through increased exposure and acknowledgement of Earth-friendly behaviors, we aim to foster permanent new habits, not just the occasional action.

That Earth-friendly behavior will become the norm, and not the exception.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/alterearth/alterearth/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
